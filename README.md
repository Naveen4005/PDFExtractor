# PDFExtractor
Hello everyone,
I'm here to help you to implement the #PDFExtractor project with existing files.
I'll explain everything step-by-step.

step 1: it is a create-react-app project
step 2: make sure to install libraries like react-dropzone and react-pdf
step 3: create a folder to keep backend files
step 4: don't forget to use "npm init -y"
step 5: from your backend folder make sure to install libraries like express, jsonwebtoken, express-validator, cors, multer, path, bcrypt, pdf-lib
step 6: I suggest you install nodemon in your backend to keep updated when changes made to your source code
step 7: don't forget to create two folders(uploads, extract-pages) in your backend directory
step 8: Please make sure "App.js" is inside the "AuthProvider" tag in the index.js file
finally 
step 9: don't forget to import CSS files
